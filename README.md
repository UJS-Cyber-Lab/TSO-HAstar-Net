# 1.Research background and purpose
The scale of poultry farming has expanded, and the application of intelligent devices has increased. However, manual inspection of cage poultry houses is difficult, and inspection vehicles are urgently needed. The traditional track inspection scheme has problems such as easy damage to the track and tedious maintenance. The existing trackless inspection scheme lacks a stable and reliable path planner, and the "one room, one vehicle" mode has high costs. This study aims to propose a new global path planner to address the aforementioned issues.

# 2.Methods
## 2.1 Environmental analysis and mapping
  Represent the poultry house environment as a global occupancy grid map, and build a semi-structured topological network based on it to provide a foundation for path planning.

## 2.2 Problem description
  The path planning of poultry house inspection vehicles needs to take into account requirements such as obstacle avoidance, maintaining straight driving, and smooth paths. The traditional HA algorithm has problems such as slow planning speed and high resource consumption. This study proposes the TSO-HA algorithm and TSO-HA * - Net hybrid path planner to meet the requirements.
## 2.3 Overall framework
  TSO-HA*-Net consists of the underlying TSO-HA algorithm and the upper layer topology planning. Firstly, determine the topology nodes and connections, use TSO-HA algorithm for path pre planning, construct a semi-structured topology network and cost matrix, and then use Dijkstra algorithm to plan the complete inspection route.

## 3.3 H2 Calculation
  The TSO-HA algorithm using DRT performs excellently in terms of planning success rate, computation time, and resource consumption, with significant advantages over LDP-MAP and A-dis.
# 4.Conclusion
  The combination of TSO-HA * - Net and topology planning shows high efficiency in poultry house experiments. The TSO-HA algorithm significantly reduces computation time and resource consumption, and TSO-HA * - Net only takes 546.62ms to plan the global route, which can meet the needs of poultry house inspection and replace traditional navigation methods. In the future, it will integrate positioning and navigation capabilities to achieve more accurate execution of inspection tasks.
