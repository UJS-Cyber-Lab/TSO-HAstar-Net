# ‚ö°Quick Start
*  ***TSO - HA***
> As a lower level planner, it is used to construct semi-structured topological networks. Integrate predefined inspection rules into the global grid map of the poultry house. This algorithm preserves the smoothness of mixed A * (HA *) paths while reducing time and computational overhead, improving the speed and efficiency of network generation.
*  ***Topology planning***
> Based on the topology network constructed by TSO-HA *, plan a smooth inspection route that conforms to the starting and ending postures. On the basis of the semi-structured topology network constructed by TSO-HA *, Dijkstra's algorithm can find the shortest path that meets the conditions, ensuring that inspection vehicles can conduct inspections along this route.

Connection points serve as entry and exit points for the inspection vehicle within the topological network. An il-lustrative example of initiating topological planning on a directed path of the semi-structured network is shown in Fig. 2, which illustrates how the planned path is seamlessly integrated into the network as an inspection route.

# üí°Contribution
### The main contributions of this study are as follows:
*  An improved Hybrid A* algorithm is proposed, which demonstrates shorter computational time, reduced re-source consumption, and a higher success rate when applied to high-resolution maps. This improvement is achieved through a new heuristic value calculation using the Distance Reference Tree and simplified occupancy grid templates for collision detection.
*  A hybrid path planner called TSO-HA*-Net is proposed, integrating the improved HA* algorithm, specific in-spection rules and topological planning. This planner is efficient and flexible for planning inspection routes in large-scale maps, establishing an intermediate planning scheme between point-to-point and full-coverage path planning. It addresses the route requirements for coop inspection and adapts to the actual poultry house envi-ronment.
*  The rail-less navigation system based on the presented planning scheme offers a viable alternative to traditional electromagnetic and line-following navigation. This study provides valuable case studies and algorithmic refer-ences for inspection tasks in caged poultry houses and similar facilities.
