# üí≠Contribution
The main contributions of this study are as follows:
*  An improved Hybrid A* algorithm is proposed, which demonstrates shorter computational time, reduced re-source consumption, and a higher success rate when applied to high-resolution maps. This improvement is achieved through a new heuristic value calculation using the Distance Reference Tree and simplified occupancy grid templates for collision detection.
*  A hybrid path planner called TSO-HA*-Net is proposed, integrating the improved HA* algorithm, specific in-spection rules and topological planning. This planner is efficient and flexible for planning inspection routes in large-scale maps, establishing an intermediate planning scheme between point-to-point and full-coverage path planning. It addresses the route requirements for coop inspection and adapts to the actual poultry house envi-ronment.
*  The rail-less navigation system based on the presented planning scheme offers a viable alternative to traditional electromagnetic and line-following navigation. This study provides valuable case studies and algorithmic refer-ences for inspection tasks in caged poultry houses and similar facilities.
